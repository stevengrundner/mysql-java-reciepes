 * This exception is used to turn a checked exception into an unchecked

 * 
 * The annotation @SuppressWarnings("serial") is used to turn off a warning
 * because this class does not declare a variable named serialVersionUID, when
 * the parent class does. Serialization is a process that turns a Java object
 * into a stream so that it can be sent across the network and reconstituted on
 * the other end. This application does not support Serialization so we don't
 * need to include the variable.
